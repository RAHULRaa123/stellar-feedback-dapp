## 📌 Description

This is a complete **end-to-end Stellar Mini dApp** built on the **Stellar Testnet** using Freighter Wallet.

The application allows users to:

* Connect their wallet
* Send XLM transactions
* Interact with deployed smart contracts
* Store and fetch anonymous feedback on-chain

This project demonstrates full-stack Web3 development including frontend, smart contract, testing, deployment, and advanced contract interactions.

---

## 🎯 Core Focus

This project primarily focuses on building an **Anonymous Feedback dApp** on the Stellar blockchain.

Advanced features like token rewards and inter-contract calls are implemented as additional enhancements to showcase deeper understanding of smart contracts.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User connects Freighter wallet
2. User submits anonymous feedback
3. Feedback is stored on Stellar blockchain
4. Feedback is fetched and displayed in the UI
5. (Optional) User receives token reward via smart contract

---

## 🧠 Smart Contracts

### 📌 Feedback Contract

**Contract Address:**
CBXTSVTRCTXSJYYTGGV6G5R3F4EI73B3QW3SZ2MAZXMFEW445VQW7MOJ

**Functions**

* `send_feedback`
* `fetch_feedback`

---

### 📌 Token Contract

**Contract Address:**
CCUNRZQPLTIPELMXVCIMDLZP3B4RLXJCGB3NPWHDUNFJNVATKAGIRPAJ

**Functions**

* `mint`
* `balance`

---

### 📌 Caller Contract (Inter-Contract)

**Contract Address:**
CCRR3NARGJ6UYRKW7N42KVN6KL6VXEHXA7AHYMB7URS7T7FIE35XCLJC

**Function**

* `send_feedback_and_reward`
  → Calls `send_feedback` in Feedback Contract

---

## 🔄 Inter-Contract Interaction

The Caller Contract interacts with the Feedback Contract by invoking the `send_feedback` function.

It also integrates with the Token Contract to reward users after submitting feedback.

This demonstrates cross-contract communication on Stellar Soroban.
