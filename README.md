## 📌 Description

This is a complete **end-to-end Stellar Mini dApp** built on the **Stellar Testnet** using Freighter Wallet.

The application allows users to:

* Connect their wallet
* Send XLM transactions
* Interact with deployed smart contracts
* Store and fetch anonymous feedback on-chain

This project demonstrates full-stack Web3 development including frontend, smart contract, testing, deployment, and advanced contract interactions.

---

## 🎯 Core Focus

This project primarily focuses on building an **Anonymous Feedback dApp** on the Stellar blockchain.

Advanced features like token rewards and inter-contract calls are implemented as additional enhancements.

---

## 🔌 Smart Contract Integration (Frontend Calls)

The frontend actively calls all deployed smart contract functions:

- send_feedback → Stores feedback on-chain  
- fetch_feedback → Retrieves feedback from blockchain  
- send_feedback_and_reward → Performs inter-contract call and triggers token reward  

All smart contract functions are fully integrated and triggered via the UI.

---

## 🚀 Production Readiness

* CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions
* Error handling for failed transactions
* Mobile responsive UI
* Optimized contract interactions
* Clean and scalable project structure

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Frontend (React) → Stellar SDK → Smart Contracts (Soroban) → Stellar Testnet

* React UI handles user interaction
* Freighter wallet signs transactions
* Smart contracts store and fetch feedback
* Token contract rewards users

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User connects Freighter wallet
2. User submits anonymous feedback
3. Feedback is stored on Stellar blockchain
4. Feedback is fetched and displayed in the UI
5. User receives token reward via smart contract
